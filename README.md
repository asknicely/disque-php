A PHP library for the very promising [disque](https://github.com/antirez/disque)
distributed job queue. Features:

* Support for both PHP (5.5+) and HHVM
* No dependencies: Fast connection to Disque out-of-the-box
* High level API to easily push jobs to a queue, and retrieve jobs from queues
* Easily schedule jobs for execution at a certain `DateTime`
* Use the built in `Job` class, or implement your own
* Smart node connection support based on number of jobs produced by nodes
* Connect to Disque with the built-in connection, or reutilize your existing Redis client (such as [predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis))
* Supporting all current Disque commands, and allows you to easily implement custom commands
* Fully unit tested

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require mariano/disque-php --no-dev
```

If you want to run its tests remove the `--no-dev` argument.

## Usage

This library provides a [Queue API](docs/README.md#queue-api) for easy job 
pushing/pulling, and direct access to all Disque commands via its 
[Client API](docs/README.md#client-api).

Create the client:

```php
use Disque\Connection\Credentials;
use Disque\Client;

$nodes = [
    new Credentials('127.0.0.1', 7711),
    new Credentials('127.0.0.1', 7712, 'password'),
];

$disque = new Client($nodes);
```

Queue a job:

```php
$job = new \Disque\Queue\Job(['name' => 'Claudia']);
$disque->queue('my_queue')->push($job);
```

Schedule job to be processed at a certain time:

```php
$job = new \Disque\Queue\Job(['name' => 'Mariano']);
$disque->queue('my_queue')->schedule($job, new \DateTime('+2 hours'));
```

Fetch queued jobs, mark them as processed, and keep waiting on jobs:

```php
$queue = $disque->queue('my_queue');
while ($job = $queue->pull()) {
    echo "GOT JOB!";
    var_dump($job->getBody());
    $queue->processed($job);
}
```
